# Student Grade Calculator

This is my first Python Mini Project. 


In this project, I created a program that takes marks for multiple subjects from the user, calculates the Total and Average,and then assigns a grade based on the average.

I build these project to practice basic Python concepts like:
  - Functions
  - Loops
  - If-else conditions
  - User Input
  - Basic Calculations

    
This Project helped me  understand how to sturucture a simple Python Program and apply logical conditions.
